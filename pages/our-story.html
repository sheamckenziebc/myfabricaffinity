              This summer pop-up is stocked full of goodies from our last
              atelier collection.<br><br>

              We are Amanda & a small team of talented helpers, who thankfully
              make MFA studio processes a fun & passionate supporter of local
              makers & creativity.<br><br>

              We originally brought these cherished textiles & threads to
              Victoria with plans to start making more few-of-a-kind fashions.
              Soon after the move from Ontario, Amanda fell ill & life had to
              pause for over 4 years.<br><br>

              Now, as Amanda heals & reconnects with her true calling -
              songwriting & singing - she’s choosing to step away from the
              fashion industry.<br><br>

              This summer pop-up is more than just a sale, it’s to support her
              rebirth; it is a farewell & a celebration of everything we’ve
              built together..<br><br>

              We’ve always had a deep love for fabric & understand the powerful
              wonders, workings & needs of a fashion maker. Amanda brings over
              40 years experience with textile & threads, beginning her work in
              fashion even before college studies in technique & design. With
              many generations of fashion design & construction in her family,
              pursuing this path felt natural. She specialized in custom design,
              with work spanning wardrobe & image consulting, costume design for
              film & music videos, visual merchandising & photo shoot styling, &
              even interiors. Though highly skilled in illustration, pattern
              drafting & sewing, her most recent years were dedicated to
              teaching & consulting with fellow makers & designers. Thank you
              for being part of this chapter.

        <p>
          Amanda & MFA are committed to helping you bring your textile projects
          to life. With joy, we present these carefully selected treasures -
          intentionally & primarily to local designers & makers. Reducing the
          need for shipping is one way we aim to keep things as eco-friendly as
          possible. Most of these textiles are natural fibers, threads made in
          Canada & come with minimal packaging. For those in Victoria &
          surrounding areas, hand delivery is available at no extra cost. We’re
          also happy to arrange shipping if needed.<br><br>

          We’re proud to offer exceptional customer service, to support &
          encourage your creative process. We wish for these beautiful, quality
          textiles & threads to bring you as much joy & inspiration as they
          brought us.<br><br>

          You are invited to text, call or email Amanda to place an order or
          book a private shopping sesion at our Metchosin studio.<br><br>
